# BigQuery Agent with Google ADK

A powerful AI-powered data analysis agent that combines Google BigQuery with the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) to enable natural language interactions with your data warehouse.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of BigQuery with Google's Agent Development Kit, creating an intelligent agent that can understand natural language queries and execute SQL operations on BigQuery datasets. The agent leverages Google's Gemini models to provide conversational data analysis capabilities.

## Features

### Current Capabilities
- üîç **Dataset Discovery**: List and explore BigQuery datasets
- üìä **Table Analysis**: Get detailed information about tables and their schemas
- üîé **SQL Execution**: Execute complex SQL queries through natural language
- ü§ñ **AI-Powered**: Uses Gemini 2.5 Flash for intelligent query understanding
- üîê **Flexible Authentication**: Multiple authentication methods supported

### Coming Soon
- üîó **MCP Integration**: Model Context Protocol support for enhanced tool interoperability
- üìà **Advanced Analytics**: Extended data visualization and analysis capabilities

## Architecture

The agent is built using:
- **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)**: Framework for building AI agents
- **BigQuery Toolset**: Specialized tools for BigQuery operations
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash**: Large language model for natural language understanding
- **Python**: Core implementation language

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Google Cloud Project with BigQuery enabled
- Google Cloud credentials (one of the authentication methods below)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/johanesalxd/bq-agent-app.git
cd bq-agent-app
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install google-adk
```

## Authentication Setup

The agent supports three authentication methods:

### 1. Application Default Credentials (Recommended)
```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

### 2. OAuth2 Authentication
Set up OAuth2 credentials in your `.env` file:
```env
OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
```

Update `credentials.py`:
```python
CREDENTIALS_TYPE = AuthCredentialTypes.OAUTH2
```

### 3. Service Account
1. Download your service account key as `service_account_key.json`
2. Update `credentials.py`:
```python
CREDENTIALS_TYPE = AuthCredentialTypes.SERVICE_ACCOUNT
```

## Configuration

### Write Modes
The agent supports different write access levels:

- **ALLOWED**: Full write capabilities (current setting)
- **BLOCKED**: Read-only mode (default safety setting)
- **PROTECTED**: Temporary data writes only

To change the write mode, modify the `tool_config` in `credentials.py`:
```python
tool_config = BigQueryToolConfig(write_mode=WriteMode.BLOCKED)  # For read-only
```

## Usage

### Running the Agent

1. Configure your authentication method in `credentials.py`
2. Run the agent:
```bash
adk web # or adk run
```

### Example Interactions

```
User: "What datasets are available in my project?"
Agent: Lists all BigQuery datasets with descriptions

User: "Show me the schema of the sales_data table"
Agent: Displays table schema, column types, and metadata

User: "Find the top 10 customers by revenue this year"
Agent: Executes appropriate SQL query and returns results
```

## Available BigQuery Tools

The agent has access to the following BigQuery operations:

- `list_dataset_ids`: List all datasets in the project
- `get_dataset_info`: Get detailed information about a specific dataset
- `list_table_ids`: List all tables in a dataset
- `get_table_info`: Get schema and metadata for a specific table
- `execute_sql`: Execute SQL queries on BigQuery

## Project Structure

```
bq-agent-app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agent.py          # Main agent definition and BigQuery toolset setup
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ credentials.py    # BigQuery credentials configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env              # Environment variables (create this)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md         # This file
```

## Security Considerations

- Always use the minimum required permissions for your use case
- Consider using `WriteMode.BLOCKED` or `WriteMode.PROTECTED` in production
- Store credentials securely and never commit them to version control
- Review and audit SQL queries executed by the agent
